Learning React by practicing each topic

In first episode --
React is a library and we can use it directly by add CDN links to our code..
React.createElement("tagname",{attributes},"children) -- with this html element is created as a object which will convert to html while rendering the element. here the children might be content or will be array of react elements
React.render(createdElement) - this will convert the object to html and loads on the page
React.root(element which needs to be considered as root) -- this will create a root element in react and will replace the html root

As this is very complex and not easy for the users to use it so jsx comes into picture to make it ease

tailwindcss with version 4.16 and above had issues with parcel download the previous versions only as per documentation the steps will work
