Hereâ€™s a clear explanation of each topic you asked about:

---

### **1. `useContext` vs `Redux`**

| Feature         | `useContext`                                   | `Redux`                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Prop drilling avoidance (simple state sharing) | Global state management (complex/large scale) |
| **Complexity**  | Simple                                         | More complex                                  |
| **Use Case**    | Light app-wide state (e.g., theme, locale)     | Large-scale apps with complex logic           |
| **Performance** | Less optimized for large apps                  | Built-in optimizations (e.g., selectors)      |
| **Middleware**  | Not supported                                  | Middleware support (e.g., Redux Thunk, Saga)  |
| **Dev Tools**   | Minimal                                        | Excellent debugging tools                     |

### **2. Advantage of using Redux Toolkit over Redux**

**Redux Toolkit (RTK)** is the official, recommended way to use Redux. It simplifies Redux in the following ways:

* **Less boilerplate**: Uses `createSlice`, `createReducer`, etc., reducing repetitive code.
* **Immutability handled for you**: Uses `Immer` internally to allow "mutating" code safely.
* **Includes Redux Thunk**: For async actions, built-in.
* **Best practices by default**: Encourages good file structure and logic.
* **Better DX**: Comes with built-in tools for debugging and development.

### **3. Explain Dispatcher**

* A **dispatcher** in Redux is how you **send actions** to the store.
* In React-Redux, this is typically done with the `dispatch()` function provided by the `useDispatch()` hook.

**Example:**

```js
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });
```

---

### **4. Explain Reducer**

* A **reducer** is a **pure function** that takes the current `state` and an `action`, then returns the **new state**.

**Example:**

```js
function counterReducer(state = { value: 0 }, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { value: state.value + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

---

### **5. Explain Slice**

* A **slice** is a part of your Redux store **dedicated to one feature** (e.g., user, cart, auth).
* Contains:

  * **Initial state**
  * **Reducers**
  * **Actions**

**Defined using `createSlice` in Redux Toolkit.**

---

### **6. Explain Selector**

* A **selector** is a function used to **extract data from the Redux store**.

**Example:**

```js
const selectCounterValue = (state) => state.counter.value;
```

* Helps optimize performance and separate logic.

---

### **7. Explain `createSlice` and its configuration**

**`createSlice`** is a Redux Toolkit function that creates a slice with reducers and actions automatically.

**Configuration object:**

```js
createSlice({
  name: 'counter', // name of the slice (prefixes action types)
  initialState: { value: 0 }, // initial state of the slice
  reducers: {
    increment(state) {
      state.value += 1; // Immer handles immutability
    },
    decrement(state) {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
  },
})
```

**It returns:**

* `reducer`: the reducer function for the slice.
* `actions`: auto-generated action creators.
